# twitter-scraper
A port of [@n0madic/twitter-scraper](https://github.com/n0madic/twitter-scraper) to Node.js.

> Twitter's API is annoying to work with, and has lots of limitations â€” luckily their frontend (JavaScript) has it's own API, which I reverse-engineered. No API rate limits. No tokens needed. No restrictions. Extremely fast.
>
> You can use this library to get the text of any user's Tweets trivially.
